```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```{r calcs, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(corrgram)
library(ggthemes)
library(party)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(plotly)
library(htmlwidgets)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
